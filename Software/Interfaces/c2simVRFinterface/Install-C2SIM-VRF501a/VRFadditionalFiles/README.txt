INSTALLING C2SIMv1.0.2 INTERFACE AND ADDITIONS TO VRFORCESv5.0.1 using c2simVRF v2.28

Thanks for help from Doug Reece of MAK.

Note that this version was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and requires VR-Link5.8 
installed.

This folder contains interface program c2simVRF (DIS and HLA1516e) and also some configuration 
data for creating mobile forces: armored cavalry section, mobile infantry squad, mobile 
irregular team, a script for a Chinook to perform an evacuation mission, and another for 
generating reports input for C2SIM.

1. Copy the c2simVRFinterfacev2.28 directory to wherever you want it to run, for example C:\. 
It contains a batch file runc2simVRFDIS.bat to run the program for DIS and runc2simVRFHLA1516e.bat
to run the HLA version. You can make a Windows shortcut from either of these files and place 
it on your desktop to start the interface. The parameters are defined in these files and in
program module main.cxx. The system name e.g. VRFORCES must match the SystemName in C2SIM 
initialzation. The first parameter is the IP address of the C2SIM server; you must edit it 
to point to the server you are using. Parameter 8 is the IP address running VRForces; you
must edit it to point to the computer running VRForces and the c2simVRF interface.

2. Add to your Windows Path Environment Variable:
C:/MAK/vrforces4.9/bin64 and C:/MAK/vrlink5.6/bin64

3. Copy the appData, bin, data and userData folders from VRFadditionalFiles into the top level 
of VRForces 5.0.1 installation (e.g. c:\MAK\vrforces5.0.1). These were provided by Dr. Doug Reece of
MAK. They will change file appData\settings\vrfGui\default_AggregateDisplaySettings.adsx and
bin\vrfLuaDIS.dll, and also add folder/files to data\simulationModelSets and userData\Scenarios. 
You can use the scenario that is loaded (Bogaland2.scnx) or make a new one that uses 
SimulationModelSet C2simEx.

4. To use the aggregated friendly (Scout Platoon) or adversary (Mobile Irregular) from the 
VRForces GUI you would look for AR Scout on the entity creation menu. Or from the C2SIM Interface, 
you would call createAggregate instead of createEntity. See for example createScoutUnit in 
c2simVRFv2.28/C2SIMinterface.cpp.

5. The Tracking_Reports scripts cause VRForces to emit entity position information in textIf.cpp
which are used by the reportCallback function in c2simVRFinterfacev2.28/textIf.cpp to create 
Position reports. The platform_send_observation and make_c2_reports scripts produce Observation 
reports. Alternately, a function is provided in c2simVRF that generates Position reports 
without the scripts. The alternate reports are activated by providing a value greater than zero 
in the ninth command line parameter where c2simVRF is invoked, the reportInterval.

6. To use the scenario data loaded: in the VRForces GUI Scenario Startup panel select 
"read from disk" and click on Bogaland2. You will have to wait while VRForces downloads the
terrain from Internet - when it arrives it should include a green playbox. When you shutdown 
VRForces do not choose to save as Bogaland2 scenario - that would replace it with whatever you 
have been running. If you want to save your latest scenario, give it a different name.

7. When starting VRForces using the launcher panel, make sure that the Simulation Connections 
Configuration block Network Interface Address shows the actual IP address of the VRForces, 
not the loopback address 127.0.0.1. To start VRForces with HLA using the Pitch RTI, use
runc2simVRFHLA1516e.bat.

8. To run the c2simVRF interface, start VRForces5.0.1 and then click on runC2simVRFDIS.bat or
runc2simVRFHLA1516e.bat. If the parameters there describe an initialized C2SIM server that is 
reachable from your network, the interface will perform a late-joiner C2SIM initialization, 
connect to VRForces, and load into VRForces simulation objects from the initialization, 
matching the SystemName in the .bat file.

9. Treatment of reports described above assumes VRForces hostile forces will be under 
command of an exercise OPFOR who are giving orders to red units and see observations about 
blue units as their own opposition. Thus red observations of the bleu force are observed 
as "FR" because that is the blue force role in the exercise.

NOTES ABOUT VR-FORCES5.0.1: 

a. Visualization of units is controlled by button "Show/Hide Units" in the row of graphic 
buttons immediately above the VRForces map. You can set this for platforms or unit icons.

b. It is possible to save time restarting VR-Forces by using the VR-Forces GUI File menu to
Load Recent Scenario. Sometimes VRForces balks at this but it does save significant time.

c. The C2SIM Reference Implmentation Server typically runs in a mode where the positions
provided during late-joiner initialization (which is what c2simVRF uses) are those where the 
objects in question were last reported to be located. To restart at the initial positions in
the initialization file, a user with the server password must run a new initialization cycle.
On the C2SIM Sandbox the C2SIMGUI has the Sandbox server password configured and the 
initialization cycle can be run using the "STOP/REST SERVER" button followed by the 
"INIT/SHARE/START SERVER" button.

d. If multiple instances of VRForces are to be run in the same exercise as independent
C2SIM systems, it is necessary to set the Session ID of each instance to a different
value. This is done in the startup panel for VRForces and the value in the 12th 
command-line parameter for c2simVRF interface and the --sessionId in the runVRF must match it. 
If they do not match you will get a message "No backends found" when running c2simVRF. 
Also the combination of Site ID and Application Number must not be duplicated in any instance. 
You can use Site ID on the VRForces launcher and the c2simVRF interface to avoid this by 
giving each instance a different Site ID.

e. For objects that normally exist on the surface of the Earth or fly over it, VRForces third 
location coordinate (after latitude/longitude) is elevation AboveGroundLevel (AGL), whereas
maritime vessels have MeanSeaLevel (MSL) elevations. VRForces has an option "ground clamping"
that automatically brings a ground object (e.g. a tank) down to local surface elevation
if it is given a higher elevation (see below to turn on ground clamping). When c2simVRF
finds that a C2SIM initial elevation or tasked elevation has not been provided, it inserts
an elevation AGL of 1000 meters to trigger ground clamping. (For aircraft, be sure to 
provide the elevation AGL if you do not want ground level.) NOTE: if the object is "under
ground", i.e. has elevation AGL -0 or less, VRForces will not execute a route from c2simVRF
for that object.

f. A shortcoming of the present c2simVRF interface is that it is unable to determine 
operational status of opposing aggregated unit objects. Thus OBSERVATION reports always 
show the opposing unit as fully operational. This is not true of entity-level objects,
which are shown as NotOperational when killed.

g. Some VRForces GUI options you may want to set:

- radio messages: visual indicator turned on/off by Settings->Display->green zigzag icon

- ground clamping: surface objects (e.g.vehicles) drop to ground by 
  Settings->Display->Enable gound clamping

- unit names on screen: Settings->toggle Entity Labels

- route names on screen: Settings->toggle Tactical Graphics

- miles vs km: Settings->Display->km/mi icon

- grid lines: Settings->Display->yellow grid icon

- VRForces routes imported from c2simVRF sometimes fail; might be made to work by editing     C:/MAK/vrforces5.0.1a/data/simulationModelSets/EntityLevel/vrfSim/human-diasaggregated-movement.sysdef
  Change (move-along-controller(ground-clamp to False.

- VRForces limits callback names to 10 chars; tasking will not work is longer unit names
  are used in the initialization file.

- if you have trouble with the small boats in VRForces running aground, you can arrange
  to have soil under the boat ignored by editing this file:
  data\simulationModelSets\EntityLevel\vrfSim\systems\movement\small-boat.sysdef
  and changing (check-soil-type True) to (check-soil-type False)
