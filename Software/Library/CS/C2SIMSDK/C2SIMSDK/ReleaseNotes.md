# C2SIM SDK for .NET Release Notes

## Version 1.2.13
* JoinSession() returns just the C2SIMINitializationBody xml content
* Fixed a bug on STOMP disconnection that happened when the client app did not provide a cancellation token

## Version 1.2.12
* JoinSession() now always returns content - would return null if state was "Initializing". 
If interested in restricting the state the invoker should query the status.  

## Version 1.2.11
* C2SIMHeader elements re-ordered to match changes seen on the Java Library code v4.8.3.1.
That overcomes issues seen in some instances of the server that may be configured with stricter validation.
* Setting header SendingTIme to UTC to match the Zulu format of the string representation sent to the server (was local time, as used in the Java version)

## Version 1.2.9
* Safer termination when client code fails to call Disconnect() before disposing
